                <li>Rinse, peel and julienne the carrots. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp of 
                    fine sea salt in a wok and cook the carrots on medium high to high heat for 2 to 3 mins.</li>
                <li>Clean/rinse the shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice them. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp of 
                    fine sea salt in a wok and cook the mushrooms on medium high to high heat until they are all cooked. 
                    (It takes 2 to 3 mins.)</li>
                <li>Make fried eggs. (While sunny side up is common, you can make them per your preference.)</li>
            </ul>

            and the egg on top of the rice. Serve.</li>
