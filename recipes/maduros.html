    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sweet plantains, or maduros, are a staple in Cuban cuisine. Grandma C. would
        always have either maduros or tostones on the side of our rice, beans, and breaded
        steak. Super simple recipe down below!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs very ripe plantains (should be black/brown)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li>Peel the plantains by trimming the ends, slicing just through 
            the skin down one side, and removing the peel. Cut into angled 
            slices approximately 1-1 1/2" thick.</li>
        <li>Place the plantains into your skillet close together, but not 
            touching, and cook for about two minutes per side, until they are soft.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium low, and cook an additional 20-25 minutes, turning 
            occasionally until uniformly golden brown. 
            The color comes from the sugar caramelizing as the plantains cook.</li>
        <li>Place on a paper-towel lined plate briefly to drain and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
